## 🛠️ Key Components

### 1. **Proxmox VE (Virtual Environment)**

- A **high-performance** open-source platform for **virtualizing** and **managing** virtual machines (VMs) and containers (LXC).
- Built on **KVM** and **LXC** technologies for efficient and flexible virtualization.

### 2. **Proxmox Backup Server (PBS)**

- A **secure** and **efficient backup solution** designed specifically for **Proxmox VE** environments.
- Implements **encrypted backups** of virtual machines, containers, and other critical data.

---

## ✨ Features

- 🔒 **Data Protection**: Ensure business continuity with automated, **secure encrypted backups**.
- ⚡ **High Availability**: Setup Proxmox VE with **high-availability** for critical workloads.
- 💾 **Automated Backup & Restore**: Schedule backups and restore with a few clicks.
- 🛡️ **Secure & Reliable**: Backup data is encrypted both **in transit** and **at rest** for maximum protection.
- 🧑‍💻 **Virtualization Management**: Intuitive web interface to manage all your virtual machines and containers.

## 📝 Installation Guide

### Step 1: Install Proxmox VE

1. Download **Proxmox VE** ISO from [Proxmox's official site](https://www.proxmox.com/proxmox-ve).
2. Create a **bootable USB** using [Rufus](https://rufus.ie/) or [Etcher](https://www.balena.io/etcher/).
3. Install **Proxmox VE** on the server hardware.
4. Set up networking and storage according to your system's configuration.
5. Access the web interface via `https://<server-ip>:8006` for management.

### Step 2: Install Proxmox Backup Server (PBS)

1. Download **Proxmox Backup Server** from [Proxmox Backup Official Site](https://www.proxmox.com/proxmox-backup-server).
2. Install **PBS** on your backup server following the official documentation.
3. Configure **backup storage** to store your backups securely.

### Step 3: Connect PBS to Proxmox VE

1. From the **Proxmox VE web interface**, go to the **Datacenter** and configure PBS as backup storage.
2. **Set up backup jobs** for VMs and containers, with options for full and incremental backups.
3. Schedule backups to run automatically at predefined intervals (e.g., daily, weekly).

## 💾 Backup & Restore Process

### **Backup Process**:

- **Automatic Backups**: Proxmox VE will handle backups according to your configured schedule.
- **Encrypted Backup**: All backups are encrypted before being stored in PBS to maintain security.
- **Data Retention**: Manage your backup retention policies to avoid unnecessary storage use.

### **Restore Process**:

1. Navigate to the **Backup** section in **Proxmox VE**.
2. Select the backup you wish to restore from **PBS**.
3. Initiate the restore process and verify that the VM/container is operational after restoration.

## 🔐 Security Features

- **Encryption**: All backups are **encrypted** using strong encryption standards to secure sensitive data.
- **Access Control**: Only authorized users with proper permissions can access backup data.
- **Backup Integrity**: Regular integrity checks ensure that backups are valid and usable for restoration.

---

## 📊 Monitoring & Maintenance

- **Proxmox VE**: Monitor virtual machines, containers, and server health via the **Proxmox web interface**.
- **PBS Health Checks**: Regular monitoring of backup statuses to ensure reliable data protection.
- **Logs**: Review logs from both **Proxmox VE** and **PBS** for any errors or issues that may require attention.

---

## 🚀 Conclusion

The **Proxmox Virtualization and Backup Infrastructure** setup offers a secure, reliable, and scalable solution for managing virtualized environments while ensuring data protection through automated backups. With Proxmox VE and PBS, you can easily manage your virtual machines, containers, and critical data while minimizing downtime and securing against data loss.
